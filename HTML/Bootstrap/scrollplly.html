    <p><b>Introduction: </b>This project explores interior architecture as a bridge through time, weaving together the past, present, and future into a cohesive narrative. It seeks to link temporal divides by reconnecting urban spaces with their overlooked histories, nurturing both community and continuity. In doing so, interior architecture serves as a medium for storytelling, reflecting the resilience of cities and their ability to turn challenges into opportunities for collective growth.</p>

    <p>Petaling Street has been struggling with the impact of rapid urban development, which threatens its cultural and architectural heritage. While modernization efforts, such as adding a roof in 2003, aimed to revitalize the area, critics argue that these changes often disregard its historic character. The fast-paced development frequently results in the loss of old materials and architectural features that could otherwise be repurposed to preserve a link to the past.</p>

    <p>The construction industry plays a major role in environmental degradation by producing waste, a problem that worsens when culturally significant areas like Petaling Street undergo redevelopment without proper heritage preservation. Many believe that modernization and tourism-driven changes threaten to erode the area’s cultural essence. In response, local advocates are pushing for more balanced approaches that integrate progress with heritage conservation, ensuring that Petaling Street retains its unique identity amid rapid urbanization.</p>

    <h1 id="Heading_2"><a href="#website">Heading 2</a></h1>
    <p>At the beginning of this interior architecture project, the designer explored ideas through models and narrative drawings. The model became a reflection on the passage of time, inspired by crumbling walls eroded by rain. While walking through the site, they were struck by the layers of history embedded in the decaying structures, each revealing stories of past inhabitants.</p>

    <p>The narrative drawing seamlessly merges old structures with modern elements, creating a dialogue between historical and contemporary aesthetics. A staircase bridge serves as a symbolic connection between two eras, maintaining the community’s social fabric while adapting to evolving dynamics. This carefully curated drawing illustrates the cycle of time, demonstrating how modern designs will inevitably age and how historical elements can be revitalized. It highlights the ever-evolving nature of architecture, where past and present continuously intersect, shaping spaces that honor both heritage and innovation.</p>

    <h1 id="Heading_3"><a href="#website">Heading 3</a></h1>
    <p>This project fosters a connection between the community and the city’s collective memory, encouraging active participation in shaping its future. Rather than merely preserving history, it plays a dynamic role in the city’s evolving identity. Visitors interact with spaces that intertwine the past, present, and future, gaining insight into their role in building a sustainable tomorrow.</p>

    <p>The spatial program is divided into three distinct zones:</p><br>

    <b>1- The Archive (Past): </b>A gallery displaying salvaged materials and the histories of the buildings they originated from. <br>

    <b>2- The Workshop (Present): </b>A makerspace dedicated to hands-on activities, emphasizing reuse strategies and design experimentation. <br>

    <b>3- The Pavilion (Future): </b>An experimental space showcasing sustainable design exhibitions and prototypes that address future environmental challenges.</p> <br>

    <p>By creating communal spaces for discussions, workshops, and exhibitions, the project strengthens local engagement and deepens the bond between people and place. It empowers the community to imagine a future that honors history while embracing innovation. The design incorporates layered elements to symbolize the passage of time, blending materials from different periods. A mix of reclaimed tiles, stone, and modern concrete in the flooring reflects temporal transitions, while transparent surfaces expose the layers beneath, revealing the site’s historical imprint.</p> <br>

    <h1 id="Heading_4"><a href="#website">Heading 4</a></h1>

    <p><b>Conclusion: </b>The project bridges heritage and innovation, promoting dialogue between the city’s past, present, and future. It integrates history with forward-thinking design, encouraging community participation through interactive spaces, workshops, and sustainable design explorations. This empowers the community to shape a resilient future while respecting its roots.</p>

    <p>Commercial architecture has evolved dramatically over the years, reflecting changes in technology, culture, and the needs of society. It’s a journey that offers a fascinating glimpse into how design adapts over time—from the iconic structures of the 19th and 20th centuries to the modern buildings of today. Understanding this evolution helps us appreciate the buildings we see around us and the influence of architectural trends on our daily lives. Let’s take a closer look at how commercial buildings have changed and the key factors driving this transformation.</p><br>

    <b>The Rise of Modern Architecture: Early 20th Century</b><br><br>

    <p>The 20th century was a turning point in the history of architecture. Architects began embracing cleaner lines, functional forms, and the idea that form should follow function. This era was the birth of modern building design—a style characterized by minimalist aesthetics and an emphasis on efficient buildings that used sustainable design principles.</p><br>

    <p>One of the most significant developments was the introduction of the steel frame, which allowed buildings to reach new heights without compromising on structural integrity. Tall office buildings, made possible by building technologies like the elevator, became symbols of urban progress. The iconic buildings of this era, such as the Chrysler Building in New York, showcased this new architectural potential.</p><br>

    <p>In these early 20th-century buildings, natural light became an important consideration. Architects recognized the need to bring the outdoors in, ensuring that commercial spaces felt open and inviting. The use of glass became widespread, with large windows offering expansive views and creating bright, well-illuminated, and airy environments.</p><br>
